# Library-System-with-Pyhton
Features of my Python program
• Can only access if you enter correct 4 digit user Id
• Gives option to do a general browse where you can see all book and relevant info
• Can do book search by genre, title or author. Doesn’t matter if you enter it in all lowercase or all uppercase
• Can do book checkout, if you enter book Id it see if it exists and whether it is available to loan, reserve or neither. When loaning it says the expiry date for two weeks from the current date.  
• Can do book return, and if the book was resereved they will be the new owners and the date will be added from two weeks of the current.
• Can do the purchase order feature where it calculates the three most popular books, and what percentage of the given budget should be spent on each genre shown in a pie chart.
 
All the program is run in the shell.
When looking at the general browse search, stretch fully wide to see it properly.
 
For book search title: can enter “the hunger games”
For book search genre: can enter “fiction”
For book search author: can enter “Suzanne Collins”
For book checkout and book return book Ids go from 1-20.
